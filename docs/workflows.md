   - This hook generates keywords for the record using helper method which uses RAKE algorithm
   - The curation contains search metadata like id, collection, nav, name, slug, description, longDescriptionMd, tags, representativeFile, promoted, keywordRefs.
   - Curations are stored inside keywords collection in sortedMatches based on score.

2. Curation Updates:
   - When a record is updated, a generic curation hook `beforePatchHandleGenericCuration` is triggered
   - This hook is passed the callback function which is used to build new curation as in creation
   - This handles the proper updating of curation when record is updated

3. Curation Deletion:
   - When a record is deleted, a generic curation hook `removeCurationFromSearch` is triggered
   - This hook removes the curation from search results

The search workflow utilizes:
- Helper methods and curation hooks defined in `curation.schema.js`
- Hooks defined in `[service_name].curation.js`
- Keywords service for querying curations and returning results
